                <h1>Built first for us, then made available to others</h1><br>
                <p>DeskTime was born out of the need for the Draugiem Group to manage their many employees. An internal application was developed, and we soon realized that we'd made a tool that could be useful for many other companies. Why not offer it to them? - we thought. And so, the development began.</p><br><br>
                <p>At DeskTime, we’re committed to accountability, transparency, and fairness. DeskTime is a product designed to increase productivity in an open and empowering environment. The added benefit? Boosting your employees and motivating them to perform at 100% of their potential.</p>

                <p>Users can now book desks, meeting rooms, parking spaces, and much more. All bookings are updated in real-time and can be viewed from a single booking grid. It's the best way to manage shared and hybrid workspaces, and another step closer to DeskTime becoming an all-in-one office management system.</p>
