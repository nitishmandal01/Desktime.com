                    <h1>Built first for us, then made available to others</h1><br>
                    <p>DeskTime was born out of the need for the Draugiem Group to manage their many employees. An
                        internal application was developed, and we soon realized that we'd made a tool that could be
                        useful for many other companies. Why not offer it to them? - we thought. And so, the development
                        began.</p><br><br>
                    <p>At DeskTime, we’re committed to accountability, transparency, and fairness. DeskTime is a product
                        designed to increase productivity in an open and empowering environment. The added benefit?
                        Boosting your employees and motivating them to perform at 100% of their potential.</p>

                    <p>Users can now book desks, meeting rooms, parking spaces, and much more. All bookings are updated
                        in real-time and can be viewed from a single booking grid. It's the best way to manage shared
                        and hybrid workspaces, and another step closer to DeskTime becoming an all-in-one office
                        management system.</p>

                            opted for per-user pricing. This lets you make easy calculations about how much you'll pay
                            based on the number of people using DeskTime.</p>
